# Changes from `std1` to `std20`

- `loadnum`, `loadvec` are removed because they can be replaced with immediate arguments.
- `splitvec` has been changed to `vx`, `vy`, `vz` that return a single component of the vector.
- `nearestent` has been renamed to `findent`.
- `copy` has been renamed to `mov`.
